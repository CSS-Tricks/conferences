byline: The conference CSS deserves.
---
CSS is the often unsung hero of Web development. For nearly quarter of a century it's added color, typography, layout, and more to the web. In that time it's gone from a straightforward language, to a complex set of capabilities, quite a few of which are little understood.

Many web development conferences cover CSS as part of a mix. But few are really dedicated to the langage alone. Curated by Hiu Jing Chen and John Allsopp, and produced by Web Directions, Hover will be exclusively focused on CSSâ€“the conference CSS deserves.
