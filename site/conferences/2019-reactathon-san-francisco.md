Workshops, hiring mixer, conference. We start the conference with an evening welcome reception with six 10-minute lightning talks, then move into Topic Tables where you can get up close and personal with speakers and experts on a variety of subjects. The following day is a full day conference & afterparty featuring some of the brightest minds and best speakers in the JS/React community.
