CascadiaJS is a conference for web developers that was started in the Pacific Northwest. We are a welcoming and inclusive community.

The conference will take place both online and in a few locations (Seattle, Portland, Vancouver BC) where we are going to organize watch parties. Over the course of 2 days you'll hear from an amazing line-up of speakers about everything from JavaScript to Web Assembly to hacking hardware to building healthy engineering teams. We can't wait, and we hope you can join us!
