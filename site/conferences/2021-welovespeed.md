Created in 2018 by and for the webperf community, the "We Love Speed" not-for-profit conference is born from the desire to share as widely as possible knowledge and experience about webperf. French (or not) web professionals, e-commerce and webperf experts, this event is for you!

Decision makers, developers… let’s meet for a day, in one of the most beautiful cities in France, to discuss web performance: its challenges, its implementation, its stakeholders but also the organization of the companies that implement it.
