JSHeroes is a two-day single track event, focusing on a wide range of topics around JavaScript and the Web ecosystems. Each year we bring a diverse lineup of speakers in front of an audience of 700 people in the beautiful heart of Transylvania, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

We believe that the community and the open-source models are well suited for our core values: learning, teaching and knowledge sharing. Our mission is to inspire other communities with the concept of open-source events.
