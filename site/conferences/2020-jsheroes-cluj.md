JSHeroes is a two-day single track event, focusing on a wide range of topics around JavaScript and the Web ecosystems. Each year we bring a diverse lineup of speakers in front of an audience of 700 people in the beautiful heart of Transylvania, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

We believe that the community and the open-source models are well suited for our core values: learning, teaching and knowledge sharing. Our mission is to inspire other communities with the concept of open-source events.

We’re publishing all data about our conference, in [full transparency](https://medium.com/cluj-javascripters/jsheroes-2019-transparency-report-3731539de52f). We are also available at any time for inquires and we`re really looking forward to sharing our knowledge about organizing international events. This way, whenever a community wants to start something similar, they can build on our knowledge.

See you all in April in Cluj!
