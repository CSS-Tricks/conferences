Reactathon is a conference for engineers who love and work with React. Talks are professionally-curated to educate and inspire you for what's next in the React ecosystem, and breaks are facilitated to ensure that each minute you invest has a maximum ROI. For example, you can easily identify the topic you want to learn about easily with the Topic Tables and listen to or discuss with core contributors and maintainers.
