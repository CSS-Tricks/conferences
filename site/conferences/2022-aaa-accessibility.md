byline: security, privacy, identity for front end developers
---
Until recently security, privacy and identity have been considered the responsibility of security experts, back end developers and operations. But as Browser privacy, security and identity APIs bring increasing capability to the front end, along with the power, front end developers are gaining ever more responsibility.

We've created Safe for web and front end developers, for many of whom these issues are a relatively small part of their day-to-day. Our aim is to keep front end professionals up to date with developments in privacy, security and identity technologies and practices, to help them deliver safer, more secure (and better) web experiences.
