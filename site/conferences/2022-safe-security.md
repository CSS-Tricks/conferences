Accessibility has been central to the Web since its inception (it's called the World Wide Web to reflect the intention of its creators that the Web be accessible to all regardless of among other things disability).

There are many great accessibility focussed conferences around the world, so why another one? Most of those conferences are designed for accessibility experts, and often address a broad range of topics associated wth accessibility.

We've created Access All Areas (AAA) for web and front end developers, for many of whom accessibility engineering is a relatively small part of their day-to-day. Our aim is to keep front end professionals up to date with developments in accessibility technologies and practices, to help them deliver a web for all.
