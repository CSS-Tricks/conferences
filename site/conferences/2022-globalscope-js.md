Most widely-used programming languages have conferences specifically dedicated to the language. CPPCon for C++, PyCon for Python, GopherCon for Go, Dart Summit, and many others.

There are many conferences that feature aspects of JavaScript: some are commercial, some community, but there are none whose primary focus is the language itself.

GlobalScope focusses specifically on JavaScript the language.
