The FrontConf is the annual conference focusing on front-end development in Munich! It's an international event with true community roots, non-commercially organized by and for front-end geeks. Feel the vibes! We have a day with interesting workshops and a day with conference talks in two parallel tracks. Topics range from top-notch JavaScript tech to CSS tricks to UX knowledge.

We gather trainers, speakers, and attendees from all over the world in the beautiful and iconic capitol of Bavaria. Experience the familiar, relaxed atmosphere of the FrontConf, meet great people and learn awesome stuff!
