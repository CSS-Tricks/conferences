JSHeroes is mostly focused on technical talks, the JavaScript ecosystem and the wonders of the Web. But each year, we pick a couple of extra topics we want to raise awareness of. In 2019, we tackle a major theme which impacts all of us one way or another: open source software. We are also committed to bringing on stage speakers that explore areas often overlooked by the community, namely: Web Accessibility, Mental Health and Balance.
