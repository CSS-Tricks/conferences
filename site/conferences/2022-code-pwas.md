byline: Progressive Web Apps and the future of the Web Platform
---
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) first saw the light of day at Code 2015, when Alex Russell, their originator, first outlined the then weeks old concept.

Since 2015, the Web platform has increased in sophistication, with new capabilities and APIs. Web Apps are increasingly closer to being first class citizens on platforms like Android and even iOS.
