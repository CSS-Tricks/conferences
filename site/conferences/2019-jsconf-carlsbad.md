Since 2009, JSConf has pushed the language outside of its comfort zone, the web browser, and into the forefront of servers, drones, robots and video games. Enjoy a very special day of exciting activities that are sure to make anyone happy from golfing to robot hacking to surfing lessons during our "choose-your-own-adventure" middle day only at JSConf US.
