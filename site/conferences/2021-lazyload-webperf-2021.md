Front end performance used to be a relatively simple taskâ€“minifying, concatenating and gzipping, a bit of smushing images, and all done.

But in 2021 it's far more than that, and only getting more complex. That's where lazy load comes in. A conference dedicated to front end performance, we'll cover what you need to know now, and what's coming next.
